# Eval-Prompt-based-TST [[pdf]](Huangrui_Chu_David_Peng_Final_Project_Report.pdf)

This is the Final Project of Topics in Natural Language Processing.

In this project, we made use of chatGPT API to test different generation prompts in the area of Text Style Transformation.

We want to thank Professor Arman Cohan for his guidance and useful feedback on the direction of this project, Simeng Han and Yilun Zhao for showing sharing useful practices for calling the GPT
API, and Joel Tetreault for providing us with the GYAFC dataset. Finally, weâ€™d like to thank our classmates in CPSC 670, who have inspired us
with their insights into so many interesting natural language processing papers.
